# About Me
I am research software specialist at the [Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC)](https://www.psc.edu/) tinkering with technology in scientific related projects.

I enjoy writing or contributing to open source projects, reusing old tech, playing with new tech, cooking and listening to good music.
