# About Me
üëã Hi there! I'm a Biomedical Research Software Engineer with a passion for building technology that empowers scientific discovery. Whether it‚Äôs streamlining computational biology workflows or crafting robust software tools, I thrive at the intersection of research and innovation.

I love breathing new life into aging tech, contributing to open-source communities, and experimenting with cutting-edge tools that push the boundaries of what's possible in science. My work bridges the gap between complex data and meaningful insight.

When I‚Äôm not knee-deep in code, you‚Äôll probably find me in the kitchen trying out a new recipe, vibing to music, or dreaming up the next big project. Let‚Äôs connect and create something extraordinary‚Äîtogether.
