# About Me
Hi there! I'm a research software specialist passionate about exploring technology in science-driven projects. I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, finding creative ways to repurpose old tech, and experimenting with the latest tools and technologies.

When I'm not tinkering with code or tech, you'll find me cooking up something delicious or relaxing with great music in the background. Let's collaborate and build something amazing!
